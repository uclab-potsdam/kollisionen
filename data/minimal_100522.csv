Hewrites about the course of the shooting: » All major storming scenes were carried out within 10 days. Due to a lack of electricity, many scenes had to be combined during the shooting, especially during nightly mass scenes. We usually shot outside at night and indoors during the day: in the Smol'nyj, in the Volkshaus and in the pavilion of the Sovkino studio. For the largest nocturnal mass scenes, we installed the lighting two to three hours before the start of shooting, so that we could then set up the equipment in other places according to a precise plan. Once the shooting was finished at one location, we immediately rushed to a second, third, etc. In this way we were sometimes 36-42, even 52 hours without sleep. But in spite of this tense state we did not allow ourselves any botch-ups. All the mass scenes and all the other central shots were filmed from different points of view with two/three cameras, on which the cameramen Popov and Nil'son worked. Under the supervision of General Popov, all the recorded material was periodically brought to the laboratory in Moscow. For the first time, due to an absolute lack of time, we did not manage to look at the filmed material ourselves before the Leningrad filming was finished.

He begins with the collection of ""Intellectual Attractions "", designs a 'subject backbone' as a starting point for the formation of chains of associations, which in 'film essays' should dialectically represent fundamental chapters of “The Capital”.

Biography,1928-03-00,,,Meets and argues with the main representatives of the Novyi LEF in the house of Sergei Tretiakov.,"Sergei Eisenstein meets with the main representatives of the Novyi LEF in the house of Sergei Tretiakov. Probably Sergei Tretiakov, Vladimir Maiakovski, Viktor Shklovsky, Aleksandr Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanova, Semion Kirsanov, Anton Lavinski and Esfir Shub were present. Even before the premiere of 'October', Eisenstein is heavily attacked by this group, as he does not present the October events as a documentary sequence of factographic material, but as an 'artistic game'. Sergei Eisenstein has nothing in common with the dogmatic demand of the Novyi LEF for documentary, unposed reproduction of real material, the schematic separation of feature and documentary film. A little later he explains with a clear allusion to 'Novyi Lef': ""The theoretical novelty - the 'documentary film' - replaced the subject with the fact. Illusion against material. The replacement of aesthetic fetishisation was followed by a fetishism of material. But fetishism of the material is not yet materialism. It remains above all fetishism [...] The newly turned page must now be approached with the radically opposite motto: Scepticism of the material."" With this, the separation from the LEF group is completed.",Biography and Personality;Cinema and Theatre,October,Novyi Lef;October;Sergei Tretiakov,Sergei Tretiakov;Vladimir Maiakovski;Viktor Shklovsky;Aleksandr Rodchenko;Varvara Stepanova;Semion Kirsanov;Anton Lavinski;Esfir Shub ,Soviet Union;Russia;Moscow;Bolschaya Nikitskaya Street,October: Ten Days That Shook the World,Materialism;Documentary,,March 1928,Sudendorf;Werner (1975): 'Sergej M.

At the same time, still under the impression of the Kabuki Theatre, he works on the theoretical questions of Overtone Montage. He develops its principle under the impression of the 'monistic ensemble' of Kabuki, in which every element (sound – movement – space – voice) is treated in a way that is identical in meaning: Various stimulus sources are combined in one picture; their composition lines are then not, as is usually the case, subordinated to a dominant in the course of the sequence, but are developed simultaneously in polyphonic montage. Just as in music there are so-called overtones and undertones in addition to the dominant keynote, so does ""this optical play with the film material being recorded together with all its secondary tones [...] result in a visual overtone complex when in perfect harmony with the music"". According to the principle of transitionl-fee playing, the abrupt change of emotional expression in the Kabuki, Eisenstein edits for example the 'separator' sequence: ""By separating polar stages of facial expression [...] sharper precision is achieved in the <playing of doubt> around the separator. Does the milk condense or not? Fraud? Money? Here the psychological process of playing the motives - of faith and doubt - broken down into the two borders - of the joyful (certainty) and the dark (disappointment).""

So we decided unanimously and without pretending to be fools, not to back out at this point, but to accept the proposal and to do it our way, knowing, however, that it would not meet any expectations and would not be understood."" Eisenstein is interested in Dreiser's novel above all ""in the game of fate. In my treatment for Paramount I emphasized this line in every way. Clyde prepares the assassination of Roberta from long hand. But then the famous 'change of heart' occurs, and in the boat he thinks of something better. Soon afterwards, an accident really happens, in which Roberta dies.

Cinema,1937-08-12,,,Sergei Eisenstein makes the final decision to direct 'Aleksandr Nevski'.,"Sergei Eisenstein notes the final decision to direct 'Aleksandr Nevski'. He initially concentrates again on the study of historical materials. In doing so, he is confronted with the fundamental problem of historical film: to present the ideas, behavior and customs of a long past epoch in such a way that they arouse the interest of the viewer without distorting historic events. Studying old chronicles, he observes that the spirit of the events of the 13th century speaks of the same feeling that moved the people of his time and in this connection he discovers an almost literal correspondence between a newspaper report on the destruction of Guernica and a historical account of the destruction of Pskov. Another problem, the depiction of 13th-century man, is solved when visiting a church in Pereslavl-Zalesski. From a commemorative plaque Sergei Eisenstein deduces that the church was built in a few months. For him this changes at a stroke the relationship with the stone columns, arches and ceilings: they now suddenly spoke to him as living witnesses of human labour. From them shone the image of creative work as an element of life. In this way Eisenstein also solves the most important task of freeing Aleksandr Nevski's ""holiness"" from its religious glory and reducing it to its core. He defines the attribute ""the saint"" as ""the highest form of esteem"". Thus the historical consideration of our current theme has also made the hero appear as the man he was: as the only victor Nevski possessed by the great idea of power and independence of the homeland.",Cinema and Theatre,,Aleksandr Nevski,,Soviet Union;Russia;Moscow;Pereslavl-Zalesski,Rus;Aleksandr Nevski,,Research;Script,,Sudendorf;Werner (1975): 'Sergej M.

Biography,1938-11-23,,,World premiere of 'Aleksandr Nevski' at the House of Film.,"World premiere of 'Aleksandr Nevski' at the House of Film. In the introductory speech Sergei Eisenstein thanks Joseph Stalin for his support in the production of the film. With this film, Sergei Eisenstein restores his long-doubted reputation as a responsible Soviet film artist. Because of the patriotic theme and Sergei Eisenstein 's largely renunciation of cinematographic experiments, 'Aleksandr Nevski' is very popular with the Russian film public. Eisenstein's directorial achievement was not as undisputed as one might conclude from the subsequent official honors. Aleksandr Dovzhenko formulated his criticism at the conference convened in February 1940 on questions of historical and historical-revolutionary film. According to Dovzhenko Eisenstein had fallen into the captivity of painting. In the Federal Republic of Germany 'Aleksandr Nevski' remained almost unknown. The first review appears in 1952 and, apart from complete ignorance of artistic intentions, is nothing more than a vile defamation in the terminology of the Cold War. It was not until 1966, after 'Ivan the Terrible II' had already started, that a distributor succeeded in getting the film through the censorship without any cuts. This first complete screening after 28 years was registered only reluctantly by the critics; among the few existing reviews, most of which offer only summaries or absurd interpretations, only one of them reveals an examination of Eisenstein's film theoretical concept. After 'Aleksandr Nevski' had once passed through the cinema chains, he disappeared again in the archives and can be seen today only in seminar screenings.",Biography and Personality;Cinema and Theatre,Aleksandr Nevski,Aleksandr Nevski;House of Film,Joseph Stalin;Aleksandr Dovzhenko,Soviet Union;Russia,Aleksandr Nevski;Ivan the Terrible II,,Screening;Premiere,,Sudendorf;Werner (1975): 'Sergej M.
