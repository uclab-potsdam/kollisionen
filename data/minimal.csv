He develops its principle under the impression of the monistic ensemble of Kabuki, in which every element (sound – movement – space – voice) is treated in a way that is identical in meaning: Various stimulus sources are combined in one picture; their composition lines are then not, as is usually the case, subordinated to a dominant in the course of the sequence, but are developed simultaneously in polyphonic montage. Just as in music there are so-called overtones and undertones in addition to the dominant keynote, so does ""this optical play with the film material being recorded together with all its secondary tones [...] result in a visual overtone complex when in perfect harmony with the music"". According to the principle of transitionl-fee playing, the abrupt change of emotional expression in the Kabuki, Eisenstein edits for example the separator sequence: ""By separating polar stages of facial expression [...] sharper precision is achieved in the <playing of doubt> around the separator. Does the milk condense or not? Fraud? Money?

Cinema,1937-08-12,,,Sergei Eisenstein makes the final decision to direct Aleksandr Nevskij.,"Sergei Eisenstein notes the final decision to stage Aleksandr Nevskij. He initially concentrated again on the study of historical materials. In doing so, he is confronted with the fundamental problem of historical film: to present the ideas, behavior and customs of a long past epoch in such a way that they arouse the interest of the viewer without distorting historic events. Studying old chronicles, he observes that the spirit of the events of the 13th century speaks of the same feeling that moved the people of his time and in this connection he discovers an almost literal correspondence between a newspaper report on the destruction of Guernica and a historical account of the destruction of Pskov. Another problem, the depiction of 13th-century man, is solved when visiting a church in Pereslavl-Zalesskij. From a commemorative plaque Sergei Eisenstein deduces that the church was built in a few months. For him this changes at a stroke the relationship with the stone columns, arches and ceilings: they now suddenly spoke to him as living witnesses of human labour. From them shone the image of creative work as an element of life. In this way Eisenstein also solves the most important task of freeing Aleksandr Nevskijs ""holiness"" from its religious glory and reducing it to its core. He defines the attribute ""the saint"" as ""the highest form of esteem"". Thus the historical consideration of our current theme has also made the hero appear as the man he was: as the only victor Nevskij possessed by the great idea of power and independence of the homeland.",Cinema and Theatre,,Aleksandr Nevskij

Biography,1938-11-23,,,World premiere of Aleksandr Nevskij at the House of Film.,"World premiere of Aleksandr Nevskij at the House of Film. In the introductory speech Sergei Eisenstein thanks Joseph Stalin for his support in the production of the film. With this film, Sergei Eisenstein  restores his long-doubted reputation as a responsible Soviet film artist. Because of the patriotic theme and Sergei Eisenstein s largely renunciation of cinematographic experiments, Aleksandr Nevskij is very popular with the Russian film public. Eisensteins directorial achievement was not as undisputed as one might conclude from the subsequent official honors. Aleksandr Dovženko formulated his criticism at the conference convened in February 1940 on questions of historical and historical-revolutionary film. According to Dovženko Eisenstein had fallen into the captivity of painting. In the Federal Republic of Germany Aleksandr Nevskij remained almost unknown. The first review appears in 1952 and, apart from complete ignorance of artistic intentions, is nothing more than a vile defamation in the terminology of the Cold War. It was not until 1966, after Ivan the Terrible II had already started, that a distributor succeeded in getting the film through the censorship without any cuts. This first complete screening after 28 years was registered only reluctantly by the critics; among the few existing reviews, most of which offer only summaries or absurd interpretations, only one of them reveals an examination of Eisensteins film theoretical concept. After Aleksandr Nevskij had once passed through the cinemachains, he disappeared again in the archives and can be seen today only in seminar screenings.",Biography and Personality;Cinema and Theatre,Aleksandr Nevskij,Aleksandr Nevskij;House of Film
