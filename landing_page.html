                        The spiral shape of this visualization was inspired by Eisenstein’s film theory of Spherical Book.

            <h3>How do these visualizations function? </h3>
            <p>Considering the all encompassing contributions of Eisenstein to the world of cinema and theatre, 
              we have visualised his monumental feats through three visualizations: Spiral, Network and Timelines. 
              Each of these three visualizations display dimensions of Eisenstein's life with different aspects as the primary focus.</p>
            <h3>Spiral visualization:</h3>
            <p>Spiral visualization is a temporal display of the journey of Eisenstein's personal and artistic endeavours. 
                It spans from his birth in 1898 till his demise in 1958, and how the legacy he left has continued till today. 
                The spiral shape of this visualization was inspired by Eisenstein’s film theory of Spherical Book. 
                The VR experience of Kollisionen also replicates the spiral in a 3D space. 
                Circles represent single day events in Eisensstein’s life (image will be added)
                Arcs represent events that spanned over two or more days  (image will be added)
            </p>
            <h3>Network visualization:</h3>
            <p>Eisenstein contributed to the world of film and theatre through his cinematic masterpieces and through his artistic ideas. 
                During his life, he travelled to other parts of the world and connected with several notable people in personal and professional capacity. 
                Network visualization displays these connections between different entities in Eisensten’s life. 
                Each of the symbol used in network visualization represents a certain category of entities 
                (symbols will be added here)
                The networks displayed in the visualisation show connections between the entities related to the events displayed in the right panel. 
                Scrolling through the rights panel in the alters the networks displayed, depending on the events visible in the right panel. 
            </p>
            <h3>Timelines visualization:</h3>
            <p>This visualization displays how different people, places, artistic concept, cinematic work and other aspects of Eisenstein's life occurred and recurred throughout his life. 
                It displays linear timelines of each of these entities.   
      
                Circles represent single day events in Eisensstein’s life (image will be added)
                Arcs represent events that spanned over two or more days  (image will be added)

            <h2 style="text-align:center;">How to explore these visualisations?</h3>
            <p>Following is a short guide on how you can explore the visualisations</p>
            <h3>Highlights</h3>
            <p>These are eight objects linked to Eisenstein’s life that we have especially focused on in information visualization prototype. 
            Clicking on these individual objects, highlights all events and categories that are directly or indirectly linked to data in the respective visualization. 
            These collection highlights can also be experienced in the VR and 3D environment.</p>
            <h3>Categories</h3>
            <p>Different dimensions of Eisenstein's life are split into four categories(
              <span style="background-color:#002fa7; color:aliceblue;">Cinema and Theatre</span>, 
              <span style="background-color:#fdd55c;">Biography and Personality</span>, 
              <span style="background-color:#ed563b;">Writing and Teaching</span>)
              and further into the overlap of these categories (
              <span style="background-color:#8a9a5b;">Cinema and Theatre + Biography and Personality</span>, 
              <span style="background-color:#f5964c;">Biography and Personality + Writing and Teaching</span>, 
              <span style="background-color:#774371;">Cinema and Theatre + Writing and Teaching</span> and 
              <span style="background-color:black;color:aliceblue;">Cinema and Theatre + Biography and Personality +  Writing and Teaching </span>). 
              Clicking on the categories highlights the related data points in the respective visualization. 
              We have assigned specific colors to each of the categories and their consequent combinations.
            </p>
            <h3>Entities</h3>
            <p>In order to ease exploration of Eisenstein’s life and legacy, 
              the entities linked to his life are also split into five categories. 
              Selecting any of the five entities highlights the related data points in the respective visualization. 
              (*symbols will be added here)
            </p>
            <h3>Sound</h3>
            <p>With Eisenstein being one of the biggest contributors to the early development of audio-visual films or ‘talkies’, 
              Kollisionen specially focused on including sound as a feature in our experience as a tribute to him. 
              There is sound encoded to different categories or dimensions of Eisenstein's life and turning on the sounds enables you to immerse yourself in the world of sound upon hover.  </p>
            <h3>Right panel</h3>
            <p>The right panel of the visualization displays detailed information of the selection corresponding to the left panel and the respective visualization. 
              In spiral and timelines visualizations, the right panel displays detail of the events if a circle or a span is clicked on, 
              and clicking on any of the highlights displays the corresponding detail of it in the right panel.
              In case of the network visualisation, the right panel shows the events, the entities connected to which are displayed through the visualization. 
              Scrolling through the rights panel in the network visualisation alters the networks displayed, depending on the events visible in the right panel.</p>
